             * Create a collection that maps 1:1 to the Task Assignments. The algorithm works as follows:
             *
             * For every process we iterate through the images of the sample to assign to them the $imageIndex modulo
             * the number of members in the task in case there's more images than members. This will grantee that all
             * users are assigned equally to every image.
             *
             * Now, as multiple users might be assigned to the same image, we iterate $repetitions times for every
             * image and use the index of this loop as an offset in the array position. This means that for two users
             * per image, the current one and the next one will be selected for one picture iteration. This also equally
             * distributes the load.
             *
             * Finally, we have to take into account the loop for the processes, as we must make sure that in two
             * different processes, no user will tag the same image. To do this, we first know that the $processes
             * variable will never have less than count($members) / $repetitions, and then, we add $processIndex *
             * $repetitions to the position index so that the member array is shifted in groups, so that every process
             * will start in a different group of users for one image.
